Sign Language Recognition System
This Sign Language Recognition System is a simple implementation using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to recognize three specific words in sign language. The purpose of this system is to demonstrate the functionality of the model and allow users to see how the recognition process works.

Usage
To run the Sign Language Recognition System, please follow these steps:
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. The system relies on the following libraries:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)
Keras (version 2.4.3 or higher)
NumPy
OpenCV
You can install these libraries using pip, for example:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python

Once the dependencies are installed, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
Locate the app.py file and run it using the following command:
python app.py

The application will launch and display a webcam.

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.

Perform the sign language gestures for the three specific words that the system has been trained to recognize.

The system will process your gestures using the LSTM model and display the recognized word on the screen.

Note: This system is trained to recognize a limited set of three words only. It serves as a basic demonstration of sign language recognition using LSTM.
